General Notes:
- Songs must be deterministic - randomness is no good.
  - The same song should always be generated for the same summoner (until the summoner levels up a champion).
  - Pretty much all procedural music generation techniques use randomness in some way.
  - To make songs deterministic, we can replace the RNG with champion mastery data.
  - Randomness is OK for generating white noise.

Options for generation:
- Markov chains (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain)
  - Stochastic/random music generation based on probability rules.
  - The next "state" (e.g. pitch, note length) is determined by the previous state, the rules, and a random number.
  - In our case, random is no good. We could hard-code the rules, then use champion mastery data to simulate the "random numbers" for the state changes.
  - Or we could use champion mastery data to generate both the rules and the state change decisions.
- Neural networks
  - Probably not useful in our case since they require training.
  - We can only make this work if we pre-train the network and hard-code the trained values.
- Genetic algorithms
  - Have the same problem as neural networks because they must be trained.
  - Probably need human feedback to evolve the algorithm.
  - Alternatively we could use an "expert system" to provide feedback. The expert system would evaluate music based on hard-coded music theory rules.
- Cellular Automata (http://tones.wolfram.com/about/how.html)
  - Kind of like Markov chains, but determines the next state based on a number of previous states.
  - For this, we would probably generate the rules using champion mastery data.

How should champion mastery data affect the song?
- Well that's a complicated question. I'm glad you asked.
- It would be nice if each champion (or at least each role) had a distinct/recognizable sound.
- We want people's songs to sound different, so it feels like your song belongs to you; it's not almost the same as everyone else's song.
- However, levelling up one champion should not completely change your song. We want your song to evolve over time, not change in seemingly random ways.
- There should always be some sound. We don't want new players to have large amounts of dead space in their songs.
- So how do we do that? Some options (we might take a combination of them):
  a) Each role controls an instrument (e.g. ADC=Trumpet, Tank=Drums, etc.)
     Each champion for a given role plays during a pre-defined section of the song (e.g. Draven first, then Ashe, etc.)
     The volume of each champion is determined by their mastery level.
     Issues:
     - This will have dead space sometimes. We'll have to fix that somehow. Maybe shorten the song by cutting dead sections out.
  b) Rules for music generation will be determined by the champion mastery data.
     Some champions will tend to create more agressive lines of music, while others will tend to create more peaceful lines.
     Some champions (like Jinx) will be more likely to break the rules of music theory.
  c) Have multiple sections, where each section features a different high-mastery-level champion. 


Ways to make songs more interesting / varying
- Reverb
- More layers of backgrounds. Maybe pick some based on champion mastery:
  - Whoosh noise
  - Guitar-ish instrument playing a regular pattern (maybe SineTooth will work)
  - Wood block
  - Hi hats
  - Toms
  - Clap noise (kind of like snare? Maybe snare is good enough)
  - Violins
  - Chorus
  - Trumpet shots??
  - Any other weird percussive noise we can come up with
- Cut out percussion for a section (could be a short section or a full section)
- Fade out transition
  - optionally build up before fading out
  - should always be folowed by a loud section
- Drum beat that doubles speed every few bars
  - Have one background that increases in volume & pitch
- Arpeggios in melody (or backgrounds)
- Play sounds backwards (especially drums)
- Pitch bend
- Fall off medium-length notes (i.e. pitch bend down)
- Pan to left/right speakers
- Piano/violin intro
- Special drum beat (more advanced than 1+3. Should always be on 1 though)
- 16th note groups/runs
- Different key signatures for different songs
- Dynamic contrast
- Modulate pitch up over time for a few bars
- Change the melody instrument between sections
- When generating sections, generate a specific "type" of section
  - Intro (see above)
  - Bass line + melody ("A" section should always have this type)
  - Quieter section (no percussion, maybe longer notes)
  - Loud funky instruments
- Sections can have varying lengths
- When replaying the "A" section, add something on top

TODO before cutoff date:
Must have:
- Write-up of what it does & development process
Nice to have:
- Fix background sounds
- Fix seeding so each champion is only part of one seed?
- Variation on drum beat
- Special section types
- Special transitions
