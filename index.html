                        <h3>Who made this thing, and why?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Hey! We're KirkBerkley and RndmInternetMan, two League of Legends players on the NA server. We created Urf Tunes for the 
                            <a href="https://developer.riotgames.com/discussion/announcements/show/eoq3tZd1" target="_blank">Riot Games API Challenge 2016</a>. If you've seen 
                            the winning entries from the previous API Challenges, you might remember us as the creators of <a href="http://red3141.github.io/UrfChallenge2015/" target="_blank">Summonurf's Rift</a>
                            from the April 2015 Riot Games API Challenge.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Cool! So what is Urf Tunes?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Urf Tunes is a procedural music generator that uses your League of Legends Champion Mastery levels to generate a song unique to your data.
                        </p>
                        <h3>How does that data affect the music?</h3>
                        <p>
                            There are a few ways we use the Champion Mastery data to alter the song. First, we use pseudorandom number generators to determine things like the form of the song, the chord progressions,
                            the pitches of the notes, the drum patterns, and so forth. We don't want the songs to be random, though - we want them to be deterministic, so your song never changes (until you level up a
                            champion). That's why we use the Mastery levels from different groups of champions as the seeds for these pseudorandom number generators. By seeding the pseudorandom number generator with
                            consistent data, the same "random" numbers are produced for the same Champion Mastery data, which means you get the same song every time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Second, we look at the total levels of some groups of champions to determine which type of introduction your song gets. Third, the sound of the primary melody instruments is created by
                            directly using Champion Mastery levels; we'll get into this a bit more in a later question, as it's really fundamental to the project.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you're interested in knowing what parts of the song are affected by a particular champion, you can search for the champion's name in our 
                            <a href="https://github.com/red3141/UrfTunes" target="_blank">code</a>; we intentionally use champion names to index into the champion mastery data to make it easier to do this.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Hold on a second. You're saying that most of this project is just seeding a pseudorandom number generator, getting some numbers out of it, and there's your song? Isn't that kind of trivial?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Not quite. We're not just playing random notes in a random order and hoping for the best. We use the numbers to move through 
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain" target="_blank">Markov chains</a> to choose the structure of the song, rhythms for the drums, pitches and durations of the melody notes, etc. 
                            In short, Markov chains are a sort of "map;" for every possible state you could be in, it defines which states you can go to next, and what the probability of moving to each of those 
                            states is. The values the pseudorandom number generator gives us define how we move through the "map." Setting up the Markov chains to produce something that sounds good can be tricky, and
                            is certainly more difficult than just using random numbers directly. We spent a lot of time fine-tuning our Markov chains to make sure it generates sweet beats.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another cool thing is that we use <i>multiple</i> Markov chains, and differently seeded pseudorandom number generators for each, so that leveling up a single champion results in changing only
                            one part of the song. This gives a similar, but still noticeably different, song, which gives a nice sense of progression as you level up champions. Another advantage of using this system is that
                            everyone, no matter how much or how little they've played League, has an interesting song.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Alright, that makes sense. So what about the "sound of the primary melody instruments" thing you mentioned earlier. Tell me more about that.</h3>
                        <p>
                            Like we said before, this is really fundamental to the project. So far, we've talked about how we use the Champion Mastery levels in ways that aren't really reversible: you can't tell
                            what Champion Mastery level you have on a particular champion just by listening to the song. However, we also use the Champion Mastery levels to generate some special waveforms for the melody instruments.
                            Basically, this means that the sound of the melody itself contains the mastery data - those bars you see in the visualizer are actually champion mastery levels (except the bars on the far left - 
                            those are low-frequency instruments like the bass).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Without going into too much detail, combining <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic" target="_blank">harmonics</a> (integer multiples) of the frequency of the note
                            can be used to create complex sounds. This happens in real-life instruments, and it's why, say, a trumpet sounds different than a piano. With a computer, we can set which harmonics we want
                            to use, and how powerful we want those harmonics to be, allowing us to create a variety of sounds. For each of the five melody instruments used in the song (outside of the introduction), we use
                            your Champion Mastery levels on 26 champions; each champion affects one of the first 26 harmonics, and the higher the Champion Mastery level, the more powerful the harmonic will be in the sound.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Obviously, determining the Champion Mastery levels from those sounds isn't something a typical human could do (and we doubt even an atypical human could do it). So how is it reversible? Enter
                            the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform" target="_blank">Fast Fourier transform</a>. Basically, the Fast Fourier transform takes the sound wave and extracts the powers of the harmonics
                            from the sound. We take this data and display it in the visualizer. You might notice that some patterns in the visualizer correspond to particular instruments. As we mentioned before, the bass and bass drum
                            are pretty skewed towards the left side, and the snare drum is at equal height across the entire visualizer (this is because it's basically just white noise). The spikes you see are your Champion
                            Mastery levels. We also show the Champion Mastery levels using the champion icons below the visualizer so you can easily identify which champions are used in the current instrument. We also dim the
                            images for lower Champion Mastery levels to make it easier to pick up on which champions correspond to which visualizer spikes.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Why'd you only use 26 champions per instrument? Why not use all 130 on the same one?</h3>
                        <div>
                            Actually, we tried that. You might notice that when the notes get lower, the spikes bunch up to the left of the visualizer, and when the notes get higher, they spread out a lot. In order to show all
                            of the data at once with the single instrument, we'd be restricted to extremely low notes, which wouldn't sound good at all.
                        </div>
                        <h3>Cool, I think I understand the basics of how Urf Tunes works now. Maybe you could tell me about how you came up with the idea?</h3>
                        <p>
                            When the API Challenge was announced, we thought about the number of different possible sets of Champion Mastery levels there are. Each champion can have six different levels (including level 0)
                            and there are 130 champions, which gives 6<sup>130</sup> possibilities. That's a bit more than 1.44 x 10<sup>101</sup>.
                            Since there are so many possibilities, it's extremely unlikely that any two League of Legends players have the same Champion Mastery data (except for players with only a few total levels).
                            This makes your Champion Mastery levels a sort of "fingerprint" - something that's unique to you. We thought it would be interesting to present that "fingerprint" in a unique way,
                            and the most unique way we thought of was music.
                        </p>
                        <h3>What are you most proud of with this project?</h3>
                        <p>
                            When we made Summonurf's Rift last year, we went into it with a clear idea of what we were aiming for, we knew what tools and libraries we wanted to use, and we had some idea of what we were doing.
                            For Urf Tunes, we had none of that. Before this project, we knew nothing about procedural music generation and little about how sound worked, we didn't know what tools and libraries were available,
                            and we only had a vague idea of what the end result would look like. We didn't even know if could figure out how to do what we wanted in only two weeks. We're glad (in hindsight) that we chose to go with
                            this project inspite of the uncertainty - we learned a lot in only a couple of weeks, and we managed to make some music that doesn't sound completely awful!
                        </p>
                        <h3>Speaking of tools and libraries, which ones did you use in this project?</h3>
                        <p>
                            The most important tool we used was the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API" target="_blank">Web Audio API</a>. This is how we make all of sound that you hear and how the
                            visualization you see. It's also built-in to your browser; nothing to download or set up, just learn how it works and go!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the recording, we used <a href="https://github.com/higuma/web-audio-recorder-js" target="_blank">WebAudioRecorder.js</a> by GitHub user higuma.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For creating the website, we also used <a href="https://jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery</a> and <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Though not a development tool or library, we found <a href="http://www.hooktheory.com/trends#" target="_blank">this music theory website</a> really helpful. It lets you look through chord progressions in popular songs
                            and see how frequently they're used, and that data translated really well into rules for our Markov chains.
                        </p>
                        <h3>You've mentioned Summonurf's Rift a couple of times now. What did you learn from that project that helped with this one?</h3>
                        <p>
                            There are two main things we learned from Summonurf's Rift.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            First, doing something unique for every champion isn't necessarily the best use of time. In Summonurf's Rift, it took RndmInternetMan
                            the better part of the first week just to make the images needed for the game. This time around, we decided that wasn't going to be a great approach, so we found different ways to use each
                            champion's data, rather than create a special sound for each champion. This saved us a bunch of time and forced us to think outside the box for how we could use each champion's data in an
                            interesting way.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Second, when we made Summonurf's Rift, we were really focused on just making the best end result. This resulted in each of us working only on the parts of the project that we already knew how
                            to do, so we didn't learn as much as we could have. For Urf Tunes, we still tried to make a great end result, but we also put a priority on our own learning, even if it meant taking a bit
                            more time to finish a part of the project.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Is there anything you wish you could have done, but didn't have time to do?</h3>
                        <p>
                            There's a lot that could be done to add more variation to the generated music. For example, all of our songs have the same kind of "feel" to them, they're all in the same key, and they all
                            have the same time signature (4/4). We decided to keep these things the same across all of the songs to simplify our music generation algorithms, but they're restrictions we wish
                            we had time to remove. We would love to add more variation between the songs, but that would require us to teach the computer (and ourselves) a LOT more about music theory,
                            and that's a bit too much for two weeks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We also had some ideas for features we wish we could've added to the site. For example, it would be cool to have a playlist feature, so you could enter a bunch of Summoner names and have
                            their songs play one after another. It would also be nice to be able to download the song immediately instead of waiting for the whole song to finish playing.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Why is the download button disabled most of the time?</h3>
                        <p>
                            You have to wait until the end of the song before you can download it.
                            We're actually building the song dynamically as it plays in your web browser - that means the song isn't fully written until it finishes playing.
                        </p>

                            Urf Tunes works best in Google Chrome. Although we've tried to make things work, we couldn't get everything working in every browser. In particular, the sound quality in FireFox is, in our
                            experience, much worse than in Chrome.
